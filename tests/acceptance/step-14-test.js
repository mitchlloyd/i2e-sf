/*
  In this step you're going to write your own tests to add a feature that
  allows users to toggle between the current and remaining time of a song in
  the now-playing footer component.

  * The currentTime is the ellapsed time of the song. Your player service
    already exposes currentTime as a property.

  * The remainingTime is the duration of the song minus the currentTime

  Use the first test as an example of how to use moduleForComponent, then
  write your own test and implement this feature.
